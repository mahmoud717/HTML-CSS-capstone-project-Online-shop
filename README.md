The project is built using HTML and CSS/SCSS with an extensive use of the grid and flex propreties. I used all SCSS core functionality: variables, mixins and color functions.

## Built With

- HTML
- CSS3/SCSS
- Bootstrap
- Font awesome icons
- Webhint/Stylelint linters
- NPM scripts for testing and running the SCSS changes

## Used techniques
 
- made a main page logo that's responsive and changes with different sizes.
- A bootstrap Carousel on the top section of the main page to show the most wanted items.
- in the Search section i Used flex box to give it a different layout at each screen size.
- Used Css grid in the main section.
- Used bootstrap cards in the Css grid to give the content a professional look.
- inside each card i used flex box to auto align the images with the description giving it a professional look.
- Used media queries to give the pages a responsive layout that looks good on all screen sizes.
